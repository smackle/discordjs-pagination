# @smacklex/discordjs-pagination

A simple utility to paginate Discord embeds. Built on discord.js@^12.0.0 (master) but should work on older versions. Compatible with MessageEmbeds, RichEmbeds (not tested). Pages are embeds.

NOTE: This is an edit of @xoalone/discord.js-pagination, I have configured it a little bit for my personal use.

# Installation

- `npm install @smacklex/dp1`
